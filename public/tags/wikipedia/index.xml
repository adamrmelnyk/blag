      <description>Writing a toy scraper As the quarantine continues and many things are still closed, I&amp;rsquo;m still spending a lot of time looking for fun side projects I can complete in a few days or less. As I drifted off to sleep one night wondering about some correlations between countries and various other data points. I realized that wikipedia probably had all the data I needed to find out. What if I could just scrape all the data off of wikipedia and throw it into sql tables so I could chart data that way?</description>
