      <description>The first time I wrote a program in hexidecimal or assembly was using a made up, educational cpu called Pep8, this was before I had read anything about how to properly organize code, programming practices, and before I had read clean code. Over the last month and a half, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a CHIP8 emulator, which you can find here, so for the first time in a while, I&amp;rsquo;m revisiting old topics and old books on computer architecture.</description>
