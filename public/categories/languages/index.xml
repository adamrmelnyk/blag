      <description>A dive into functional programming in Racket.
Preface I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with functional languages for a few years now; I&amp;rsquo;d pick up an ebook on scala or Clojure some Saturday afternoon and try going through a tutorial or two. Maybe attend a workshop on it over a weekend with a friend who found the event on meetup.com and get a somewhat shallow overview of the language. The next weekend I&amp;rsquo;d look at it again and see if I could get a small webpage up and running or maybe a small command line tool but for the most part, it has always ended there.</description>
