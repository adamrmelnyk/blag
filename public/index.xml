      <description>A dive into functional programming in Racket.
Preface I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with functional languages for a few years now; I&amp;rsquo;d pick up an ebook on scala or Clojure some Saturday afternoon and try going through a tutorial or two. Maybe attend a workshop on it over a weekend with a friend who found the event on meetup.com and get a somewhat shallow overview of the language. The next weekend I&amp;rsquo;d look at it again and see if I could get a small webpage up and running or maybe a small command line tool but for the most part, its always ended there.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An attempt at making my way through one of the most infamous computer science books&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recently gifted the first volume of Donald Knuth&amp;rsquo;s: &amp;ldquo;The Art of Computer Programming&amp;rdquo;. Being the computer geek that I am, I have never been so excited yet, intimidated about sitting down and working through what some people would call a Reference book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reading Parquet Files With Java</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A simple way of reading Parquet files without the need to use Spark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently ran into an issue where I needed to read from &lt;a href=&#34;https://parquet.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Parquet&lt;/a&gt; files in a simple way without having to use the entire Spark framework. Though inspecting the contents of a Parquet file turns out to be pretty simple using the &lt;code&gt;spark-shell&lt;/code&gt;, doing so without the framework ended up being more difficult because of a lack of documentation about how to read the actual content of Parquet files, the columnar format used by Hadoop and Spark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
